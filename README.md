The novel coronavirus(also called COVID-19) brings dramatic changes to our lives and may keep its impact profoundly. The United State closes the border and declares a state of emergency.The bloomberg estimates the unemployment rate will rise to over 20% in April, which is a renaissance of the 1929 crisis.Here you will see the significance of social distancing and shelter-in-place,otherwise, the number of cases and deaths will be too shocking to tolerate.

## How infectious it is
We will take Timeseria as an example. For the first 40 days, the situation seems controllable, however, COVID-19 showed it infectivity by sickening more than 30,000 people at day 66. From nothing to tens of thousands within two months, without a single momentum of containment.

## The initial number might be deceiving
Here we gonna ask ourselves: Does the number really reflect what's going on out there? Since the first case was detected two months ago, why does it take so long (almost 40 days!) from 1 case to 10 cases, but then 20 days from 10 to 30,000? This is nonreasonable. Digging into the very root of this issue, one will be confirmed cases only if he or she tests positive for the virus test, associated with the difficulty for people to get tested, we can speculate that the lack of alertness and the incapability for adequate testing, lead to the horizontal line for the initial 40 days. Fortunately, this gives us a hint that expanding testing capacity is one of the keys to end this unprecedented crisis.

## What the future will be?
Assuming no public health restriction is implemented, we forecast 10 future data points(the number of cases in next 10 days), which is frightenning. All models indicate that more than 100,000 people will be infected in day 76, according to the CDC, [the motality rate of the coronavirus is 5%](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm), which means 5,000 people will die of this pandemic. This is why government urges everyone to shelter in place to slow the spread of the virus. If we do nothing to eliminate this vital virus, the next death could be anyone next to you. So please make sure staying at home to fight the virus all together!
