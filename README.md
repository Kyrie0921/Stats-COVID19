The spreading coronavirus(also called COVID-19) is shaping up as a pandemic of potentially historic proportions, bringing dramatic changes to our lives and may keep its impact profoundly. As countries borders being closed and state emergency being announced, the situation is supposed to be better. However, the statistics reveals that it is unlikely to foresee a flatten curve in close future. How could that be?

## “Exponentially” is not enough to describe its infectiousness.
We will take Timeseria as an example. With only 26 confirmed cases for the first 40 days, COVID-19 showed it infectivity by sickening more than 30,000 people at day 66. The number rises over 1000 times in only 26 days. We may explain this by covid-19’s long incubation period (14days) and its confounding symptoms in comparison with cold, flu and fever. However, these suggest that the outbreak of the virus is far away from ceasing.

## Can we make it controllable?
Conclusion first: Don’t be panic and YES it is, but it takes time.
 
Digging into the very root of the issue that the confirmed cases has such a huge difference between different period, it is the lack of alertness and the incapability for adequate testing at first. Long incubation period makes people slow to react to the virus, and the symptoms won’t be so serious for most people that they will not even go for a test at all. Then it will be slow for the test centre to react as the number is too small at first.
 
However, after 1 or 2 full incubation period, those who carry the virus and not having a strong enough immune system will have to go to hospital seeking medicine’s help. With such a long time of accumulation, it is not surprised to see the explosion after 26 days.
 
Fortunately, this gives us a hint that expanding testing capacity is one of the keys to end this unprecedented crisis. As an old saying goes, One rotten apple spoils the barrel. We need to find all rotten apples, give them treatment and stop their spreading. It needs time to do so, to clear the accumulation in the first twenty several days, and meanwhile, the medical system cannot be penetrated, the nation machine cannot be breaking down, and the most important one is, people cannot be breaking down.

## What the future will be?
Assuming no public health restriction is implemented, we forecast 10 future data points (the number of cases in next 10 days), which is frightenning. All models indicate that more than 100,000 people will be infected in day 76. [Given the motality rate of the coronavirus is 5%](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/index.htm),5,000 people will die of this pandemic.
 
This is why government urges everyone to shelter in place to slow the spread of the virus. If we do nothing to eliminate this vital virus, we possibly have to bear the result of herd immunity, which is essentially a draw that carried 5% chance of death that everyone must take.

## Final Word
The data is only a number, but behind a number is a tragedy to a person, to a family and to those around him. I wishes our prediction is way too high. Please,
DO SOMETHING, as there is still time.
DO SOMETHING, as there is no one you know being tortured by virus.
DO SOMETHING, for sake of not only you.
